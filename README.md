This is a prediction and simulation of consumer movements in a supermarket accoding to a Markov-Chain based on actual customer behaviour.

How to run the simulation:

  -Clone the repository to your local computer
  
  -run the file final_project_week08_withwaiting.py on your terminal by typing:
  
    'ipython final_project_week08_withwaiting.py'
    
  -the program will ask for user input: Type the ammount of customers you want to simulate.
  
  -the program will then create fake names and simulate their behaviour in the supermaket.
